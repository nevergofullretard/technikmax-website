# Wavescroll (drag background)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/suez/pen/wMOVXz](https://codepen.io/suez/pen/wMOVXz).

Based on this amazing site - http://jetlag.photos

https://css-tricks.com/creating-wavescroll/ - tutorial about this demo.

Original site uses canvas. I'm still bad at canvas, so I decided to recreate most of their effects with default html+css+js combination. And special thanks to GSAP :)

Performance on desktop is quite good.  On phones there are some perf issues and visual bugs, like bg parts dark edges during the movement.
